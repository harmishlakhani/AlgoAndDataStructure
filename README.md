AlgoAndDataStructure
====================

This repo is used to store all the algorithms and data structure related codes.

1. All the topcoder SRMs developed by me(handle -> hcl) is there in repo.
2. All the GCD code developed by me for practice problems is there in repo.
3. Other CareerCup practice problems is also there in repo.


If you think there is any problem in any of the code or if you have more optimized code then feel free to suggest.
